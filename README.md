This is a modified version of the Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen. It includes the following changes:

* Physical/Special Split
* Fairy types
* Cross-gen evolutions (they currently have no sprites)
* Lots of new moves
* Buffs to a bunch of Pokemon. Some of them may have been buffed a bit too much.
* Updated movepools based on Gens 7, 8 or 9
* Unlimited Use TMs
* Remixed boss fights

All features (planned or implemented) are documented in the Xeldromix Changes folder.

I personally treat this hack more like a remix of FireRed rather than an improvement. There's tons of "FireRed but better" hacks out there, so I'm much more interested in making one that's meant to be a bit different.

It uses the following patches:

* [Evolution Moves](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=10364471) by Lunos
