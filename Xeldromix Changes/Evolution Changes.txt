(NOTE TO SELF: None of these have actually been done yet)

IN BREIF:

- Trade evolutions are evolved by friendship instead
- Trade evolutions that require a held item are instead evolved by using that held item from the bag.
- Pokemon that would evolve due to a super electric current or whatever will now instead evolve with a Thunder Stone (Similar to Sword and Shield)
- Some Pokemon from later generations have been added; this is exclusively Pokemon who evolve from older 'mons.
- Friendship evolutions can now be obtained prior to getting the National 'Dex
- Espeon and Umbreon use the Sun and Moon stone respectively. This is not a QoL feature and don't complain if it gets axed if I figure out how to add back the day-night cycle.
