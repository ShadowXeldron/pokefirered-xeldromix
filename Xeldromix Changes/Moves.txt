# Comment

HM Alterations
(HMs are still in the game because I have Retro Pokemon Stockholm Syndrome. These changes are made to make them a bit more viable)


CUT
+ Has a boosted critical hit rate
~ Is now Steel-type

FLASH
+ Now does damage; it has a power of 40
+ Now has 85% accuracy
- PP lowered to 10
~ Is now a Fairy-type Special Move
# These changes basically turn it into a better version of Mud-Slap and make it into a Fairy coverage option during the early game

FLY
+ Increased power to 70
# 90 (which is its power from DP onward) seems a bit much for when you get it

STRENGTH
+ Now has a 10% chance to flinch

ROCK SMASH
+ Increased power to 75
- Lowered accuracy to 95%
# You'd expect Rock Smash to be at least decent for when you obtain it. It's now essentially Fighting-type Razor Shell.

DIVE
+* Increased power to 80

KNOCK OFF
- No longer increases in power if it knocks off an opponent's held item

Normal Moves

SPIKE CANNON
~ Is now Steel-type
# No Normal-types can actually learn Spike Cannon so why is it a Normal-type move? Needless to say, it's no wonder that they forgot all about this move until Gen 7 and eventually axed it altogether in Gen 8.

SPLASH
~ Is now Water-type
# It's still useless and the type change was only for consistency with Pokemon Go. Any complaining memers who are mad that I didn't turn it into a 255 power never-missing Water-type multi-hitting version of Pay Day that also fully restores your HP will be sent to the lava pit. With that said, I have another plan for those who are dedicated enough to get a Magikarp to Level 100... (something that would benefit Gyarados in particular)

KINESIS
~ Is now Special
+ Power increased to 65
+ Accuracy increased to 100
+ Now removes held items
- No longer lowers accuracy
# Yes I really did turn Kinesis into Knock Off. I like it when my signature moves don't suck.

SUBMISSION
+ Power increased to 95
+ Accuracy increased to 100
- PP reduced to 15
# 80 power and 80% accuracy for a recoil move that's usually learned somewhat late doesn't make sense. It makes a bit more sense in Gen 1 where Submission is a department store TM, but since the much more useful Brick Break has taken its place as the Department Store TM it doesn't really need that balancing factor. And besides, this move is called Hell Wheel in Japan and that's just rad; why would we let such a rad-sounding move be such a letdown?

WILD CHARGE
+ No longer does recoil damage

ROLLING KICK
+ Power increased to 80
+ Accuracy increased to 95

TWINEEDLE
+ Now has a 25% chance to poison per hit

ROCK THROW
+ Accuracy increased to 100
# This is to give it something over the progression-mandatory Rock Tomb.

DRAGON RAGE
+ No longer does static damage. This is now a move with 40 base power.
+ Now has a 20% flinch chance
+ PP increased to 20
# It's meant as a low-power move for physical dragons. It's now pretty much Twister but it can't hit targets in the semi-invulnerale turn of Fly.

SCALD
- Burn chance lowered to 20%
- Accuracy lowered to 90%

BELCH
- PP lowered to 5
+ Now has a 30% chance to confuse the target
# This is a complete rework of the move Belch since I don't want to add the berry thing, but I also don't want it to just be special Gunk Shot.

DRILL PECK
+ Now has a boosted critical hit ratio

STRENGTH
+ Now has a 20% chance to boost the user's attack stat

TAKE DOWN
+ Accuracy increased to 100%

POISON STING
+ Base power increased to 35

MOVE NAME CHANGES

Some move names from later generations have been on the recieving end of the character limit and, as a result, have had to be renamed.
Draining Kiss -> Drain Kiss
Disarming Voice -> DisarmVoice
