BATTLE SYSTEM CHANGES

 - STAB is now only a 1.25x boost
 - Critical hits only occur if they have been boosted by at least one stage
 - To make the game harder, Revives cannot be used in battle
 - One stage of critical hit bonuses now provides a 5:1 critical hit ratio
 - Ice now resists Water and Dragon
 - Fairy is now weak to Bug
 - Magma Armour now provides an immunity to Water-type moves

Ideas
 - Replace Freeze with Frostbite
 - Replace Sleep with Drowsy (nerf Rest to compensate)
 - 4x Super Effective moves now only have a 2.5x boost
 - 4x Not Very Effective moves now only have a 0.4x reduction
 - Maybe add Terastalisation?
