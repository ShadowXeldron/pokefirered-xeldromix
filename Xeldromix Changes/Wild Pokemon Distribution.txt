IN BREIF:

- Kanto's biodiversity is now a lot better - you should now be able to encounter Pokemon from the Hoenn and Johto regions! Encounter tables are loosely based on HGSS and the Let's Go games.
- Every route contains a different Pokemon in each encounter slot. This means that you'll see far more Pokemon on your quest
- You can now catch extra starters
