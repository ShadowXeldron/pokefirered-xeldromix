NEW AREAS

Cinnabar Volcano
A new optional dungeon containing Entei at the end. This is meant to be the volcano that erupted and destroyed Cinnabar Island.
PROGRESS - Basically 1%. At least this idea has one map.

PLANNED

Elegant Valley
Another area at the Sevii Islands. It's accessible by entering a cave at One Island. As the name suggests, it's meant as a place for you to grind out your effort values. The Elite Four and the eighth gym will be seeing a level spike that can be mitigated by the Sevii Islands sidequest and training at this location.

This was inspired by an old Roblox Pokemon fan game which had an area of the same name that served a similar purpose.

The Valley is split into one area for every stat. 
	HP AREA - The field accessed by surfing in. A Channeler in the center of the map will offer to reset your lead Pokemon's effort values in exchange for a Heart Scale. There's also a rest house where you
	can heal.
	ATTACK AREA - A craggy area. Outside of the Attack EVs, you'll want to come here for the free Choice Band
	DEFENCE AREA - A cave full of rocky things. With Rock Smash in hand, you can break open the Secret Chamber.
	SPECIAL ATTACK AREA - A waterfront. The Psychic TM has been moved here and is hidden behind a Strength puzzle.
	SPECIAL DEFENCE AREA - A flower field. The Cut Master for Leaf Blade is located here. 
	SPEED AREA - Open fields located at the back of the area. There's a heart-shaped pond that only contains Luvdisc on top of a waterfall - return once you get the HM for Waterfall in order to farm infinite
	Heart Scales.
	SECRET CHAMBER - This is a chamber hidden behind Rock Smash. It contains a braile puzzle involving an Awakening and leads to Jirachi.

Despite being a good spot to train, the Pokemon here have an Elite Four power level. While this means you'll be getting more experience, you will still need to put in sufficient training.

WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE BUT I WOULDN'T COUNT ON IT

Restore unused Sevii Islands maps or recycle them into Elegant Valley

Maybe Johto?
