Changes made to moves in the Xeldromix project

Key:

+ Buff
- Nerf
~ Neutral Change
* Change made for parity with newer games (will also be prefixed with another symbol if need be)
^ Change made to moves added in later generations in order to improve/balance them
? Change that may be made if I get around to expanding the game's features enough
# Comment

HM Alterations
(HMs are still in the game because I have Retro Pokemon Stockholm Syndrome. These changes are made to make them a bit more viable)


CUT
+ Has a boosted critical hit rate
~ Is now Steel-type

FLASH
+ Now does damage; it has a power of 40
+ Now has 100 accuracy
# These changes basically turn it into a better version of Mud-Slap
? Maybe make it a Fairy-type move if I get around to adding it?

FLY
+ Increased power to 70
# 90 (which is its power from DP onward) seems a bit much for when you get it

STRENGTH
+ Now has a 10% chance to flinch

ROCK SMASH
+ Increased power to 70
+ Now has a 100% chance to lower defence
# You'd expect Rock Smash to be at least decent for when you obtain it

DIVE
+* Increased power to 80

Normal Moves

SPIKE CANNON
- Lowered power to 18
~ Is now Rock-type
# This is meant to make it equivalent to a lesser version of Rock Blast. Also, no Normal-types can actually learn Spike Cannon so why is it a Normal-type move? Needless to say, it's no wonder that they forgot all about this move until Gen 7 and eventually axed it altogether in Gen 8.
